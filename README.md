Who Am I?

I’m a student of Systems Analysis and Development at the alpha college of engineering(ACE)
My journey in technology started early: at the age of 14, I began programming small 3D games in Unity, and soon after, I immersed myself in the world of 2D games using GameMaker.
At 15, I discovered my creative side and worked as a freelance graphic designer, which also fueled my passion for interfaces and visual aesthetics.

When I turned 18 and entered college, I fully dove into programming.
Since then, I have been dedicating my time to studying development in depth, with a special focus on Fullstack Web Development.
Although I study the complete ecosystem, my real strength and the area I enjoy exploring the most is Front-End, where I can combine logic, creativity, and design.</p>
