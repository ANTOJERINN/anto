<p align="right">I am Anto Jerin Joshva, a Computer Science and Engineering student who gives a damn about building things that actually work. I dive deep into Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and software development because I don’t just want to write code -I want to build shit that makes an impact. From training deep learning models that catch leaf diseases to creating AI chatbots and fullstack platforms, I push myself to break limits and figure out the hard stuff. I believe in experimenting, failing fast, fixing the fuck ups, and growing stronger with every project. For me, technology isn’t just a skill — it’s my way of changing the game.</p>
